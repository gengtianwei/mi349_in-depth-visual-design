<h1>In-Depth Visual Design</h1>
<p>In-depth visual design has always been a direction that I am particularly interested in. This time, the in-depth visual design has a connection with the webpage that I learned. I learned from the article provided by the link that visual design is about creating and aligning the overall beauty of the product. In order to create the aesthetic style of a website or application, we use the basic elements of visual design and arrange them according to design principles. Seven elements and eight principles are mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>The seven elements are line, shape, negative/white space, volume, value, color and texture. These elements are the basic tools used by visual designers in their daily work, and a basic understanding of them is definitely a prerequisite for work. The line is the most basic element. The elements of visual design describe the basic elements of product aesthetics. unity, gestalt, hierarchy, balance, contrast, scale, dominance, and similarity. Design principles tell us how these elements can and should work together to achieve the best results. The article enumerates the elements and principles of Google and Quartz websites, lists the advantages of these two websites and their unique styles.</p>
<p>So why are visual design principles important? First increase availability. Following these visual design principles usually results in an easy-to-use layout. For example, the golden ratio that is often used to create beautiful artworks is also used in typography to create a visually pleasing relationship between font size, line height, and line width. The result is usually a shorter line length, which creates a balance on the web page and makes the text easier to read. When used in conjunction with powerful interaction design, visual design will increase task success rate and user engagement. Secondly, it stimulates emotion and joy. Beautiful things cause positive emotions. By following good visual design principles, designers can create beautiful-looking UIs that make users feel good. Finally, it can strengthen brand awareness. A powerful visual system can build user trust and interest in the product, and appropriately represent and strengthen the brand.</p>
